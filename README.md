# Portfolio-template
Vanilla JS boiler plate for a portfolio site
Key Features

You can run this portfolio website very easily without needing to create separate files. The entire website is contained in a single HTML file for simplicity and speed. Here's how to run it:

### Method 1: Direct HTML File
1. Copy the entire code from the artifact
2. Create a new file called `index.html` on your computer
3. Paste the entire code into this file
4. Save the file
5. Double-click the HTML file to open it in your default web browser

### Method 2: Using VSCode Live Server (or similar)
1. Copy the entire code from the artifact
2. Create a new file called `index.html` in VSCode or your preferred editor
3. Paste the entire code
4. Save the file
5. If you have the Live Server extension in VSCode, right-click the file and select "Open with Live Server"

### Method 3: Online Code Playground
1. Go to a site like CodePen, JSFiddle, or CodeSandbox
2. Paste the entire code into the HTML section
3. Run the code in the playground

### Benefits of Single-File Implementation:
- No build process required
- No dependencies to install
- Incredibly fast loading times since all resources are in one file
- Easy to host on any platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- Simple to modify and update

This approach is perfect for a portfolio site because it prioritizes loading speed and simplicity while still providing a modern, interactive experience. The website is entirely self-contained, making it easy to deploy anywhere.
